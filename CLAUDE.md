# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

`claude-sync` is a Go CLI that syncs `~/.claude/` (Claude Code state: sessions, agents, skills, plugins, settings, history, global `CLAUDE.md`) across devices via encrypted cloud storage (Cloudflare R2 / AWS S3 / GCS). Files are gzip-compressed, then age-encrypted before upload. The canonical binary is distributed as pre-compiled platform-specific npm packages; a tiny Node wrapper at `bin/claude-sync.js` dispatches to the right binary.

## Common Commands

```bash
make build            # build ./bin/claude-sync for the host platform
make test             # go test -v ./...
make check            # pre-commit equivalent: gofmt -l, go vet, go test -short
make fmt              # go fmt ./...
make lint             # golangci-lint run (requires golangci-lint installed)
make build-all        # cross-compile darwin/linux × arm64/amd64 into ./bin/
make setup-hooks      # install .githooks/pre-commit (runs on every commit)

# Run a single test
go test -v -run TestName ./internal/sync/
go test -v ./internal/crypto/ -run TestGenerateKeyFromPassphrase

# Integration tests (require real R2 credentials; behind build tag)
go test -tags=integration -v ./integration/...
# or: cd integration && docker-compose up --build
```

Version is injected at build time: `-ldflags "-X main.version=<version>"`. `make build` pulls the version from `git describe --tags --always --dirty`.

## Architecture

Layered, with a pluggable storage abstraction:

- **CLI layer** — `cmd/claude-sync/main.go`. Cobra commands (`init`, `push`, `pull`, `status`, `diff`, `conflicts`, `reset`, `update`, `changelog`, `mcp`) plus Survey-driven interactive wizards. All user-facing output lives here.
- **Sync layer** — `internal/sync/`. `Syncer` orchestrates push/pull; `SyncState` (`state.json`) tracks per-file SHA256 hash + size + mtime + last-uploaded time. `DetectChanges` compares local files against state to produce `add/modify/delete` work items. Push/pull both run uploads/downloads with a worker pool (`defaultWorkers = 10`).
- **Crypto layer** — `internal/crypto/encrypt.go`. Wraps `filippo.io/age` (X25519 + ChaCha20-Poly1305). Supports two key modes: random (`GenerateKey`) or passphrase-derived (`GenerateKeyFromPassphrase`, Argon2id with a **fixed salt** `sha256("claude-sync-v1")` so the same passphrase yields the same key on any device). The derived 32 bytes are clamped for X25519 then Bech32-encoded as an `AGE-SECRET-KEY-…` identity.
- **Storage layer** — `internal/storage/`. `Storage` interface (`Upload`/`Download`/`Delete`/`DeleteBatch`/`List`/`Head`/`BucketExists`) with three adapters: `r2/` (AWS SDK v2 pointed at `<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`), `s3/` (AWS SDK v2), `gcs/` (Google Cloud Storage SDK). Adapters **self-register** via `init()` functions setting package-level `storage.NewR2` / `NewS3` / `NewGCS` vars; `cmd/claude-sync/main.go` blank-imports them to wire up the factory (`storage.New`). Add new providers by following this pattern.
- **Config layer** — `internal/config/config.go`. YAML at `~/.claude-sync/config.yaml` (perms 0600). Supports both new unified `storage:` block and legacy R2-only top-level fields — `GetStorageConfig()` handles migration. `SyncPaths` defines what gets synced under `~/.claude/`; edit there to change the sync scope.

### On-disk layout

```
~/.claude-sync/         # tool's own state (perms 0600/0700)
├── config.yaml         # storage + encryption config
├── age-key.txt         # encryption identity (derived or random)
└── state.json          # per-file hash/size/mtime + last push/pull times

~/.claude/              # what gets synced (see config.SyncPaths)
```

### Sync semantics

- **Remote keys** are local paths with `.age` appended. Files under `_external/` on remote are reserved for MCP sync (see below) and are filtered out of regular pull/diff.
- **Push** encrypts only files whose current hash differs from state; deletions detected from state are batched via `DeleteBatch`.
- **Pull** downloads when the local file is missing, or when remote `LastModified` is after the state's `Uploaded` time. If the local hash **also** differs from state (both sides changed), it's a **conflict**: local is kept, remote is written to `<path>.conflict.<timestamp>`. `claude-sync conflicts` resolves them (and updates state on resolution).
- **First pull with existing local files** is handled specially in `cmd/claude-sync/main.go` (`handleFirstPullWithExistingFiles`): shows a preview diff and offers backup-to-`~/.claude.backup.<ts>`/overwrite/abort.
- **Backward-compat read path**: decrypt always attempts gzip decompression only if magic `0x1f 0x8b` is present, so older uncompressed remote blobs still work. Write path always compresses.
- **Key verification**: during `init`, after deriving the key, `verifyKeyMatchesRemote` downloads a small remote file and tries to decrypt it. Mismatch triggers the 3-way prompt (retry passphrase / clear remote / abort).

### MCP sync

`~/.claude.json` holds global MCP server configs. Unlike regular sync, MCP uses a **three-way merge** (`internal/sync/mcp.go`) against a baseline stored in `SyncState.MCPBaseline`. On pull, local vs remote vs baseline are merged; conflicting server entries keep local. Paths inside MCP server commands/args are home-relative-normalized (`NormalizeMCPServers`) before upload and resolved back to absolute on pull. Remote key is fixed: `_external/mcp-servers.json.age`. Toggle via `mcp_sync: true` in config or the `--include-mcp` flag.

## Distribution & release

- Pre-built binaries ship as 6 platform-specific npm packages under `npm/<platform>/` (`darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `linux-x64`, `win32-arm64`, `win32-x64`). `package.json` lists them as `optionalDependencies`; npm installs only the one matching the host. `bin/claude-sync.js` resolves and execs the right binary.
- Releases are automated via **semantic-release** (`.releaserc.json`) on pushes to `main`. The `prepareCmd` runs `VERSION=${nextRelease.version} make build-all`, then uploads the 4 Unix binaries to GitHub Releases. `install.js` / `claude-sync update` both download from the GitHub Releases API.
- Version bumps come from Conventional Commits (`feat:` → minor, `fix:` → patch, `feat!:`/`BREAKING CHANGE` → major). Don't hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` or the version in `package.json` — semantic-release owns both.

## CI & pre-commit

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `go test -v ./...`, enforces **60% coverage** on `internal/*` packages, builds, and runs golangci-lint. Keep changes to `internal/` covered.
- `.githooks/pre-commit` (enabled by `make setup-hooks`) runs `gofmt -l`, `go vet`, `go test ./... -short`, and golangci-lint if installed. Run `make check` locally before committing to mirror it.

## Gotchas

- **Path-based session indexing**: Claude Code keys session dirs by absolute filesystem path (e.g. `~/.claude/projects/-Users-alice-code-foo/`). Syncing does not remap paths, so sessions only resume on another device if the project lives at the same absolute path. This is a documented limitation, not a bug — see README "Limitations".
- **Storage adapter imports**: anything outside `cmd/claude-sync/` that calls `storage.New(...)` must also blank-import the adapter packages it needs (see `internal/sync/sync.go` top). Forgetting this produces a runtime "unsupported storage provider" error, not a compile error.
- **Symlinks are skipped** by `GetLocalFiles` — don't rely on symlinked content inside `~/.claude/` being synced.
- **The Argon2 salt is intentionally fixed** in `crypto.GenerateKeyFromPassphrase`. Do not "fix" it to per-user random — doing so breaks cross-device sync (the whole point of passphrase mode).
- **Do not add destructive operations** to the default code path without an explicit `--force` or interactive confirm — the CLI is careful about backups (`~/.claude.backup.<ts>`), key-mismatch detection, and `.conflict.<ts>` files for a reason.
